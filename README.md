# The Who, What, When, Where, Crime in LA

In recent years, we have seen the militarization of police departments around the 
country and some have claimed that the United States is moving towards becoming a 
police state. As the police become more militarized, incidents of violent 
encounters with the public have become more and more frequent. However, we must 
ask ourselves, is militarization of the police the right way to go? Is there a 
need for such heavy handed response to quell crime? Do we really need blanket 
militarization of the police or can we be more tactical in our spending and 
only equip and train specific districts? In order to have that discussion, we 
must first take a look the nature of the crimes, their victims, and their methods 
of operation (MO). 
	
For this study I examine various characteristics of Crime incidents in Los Angeles 
from 2011 to the present (2019) based on data provided by the Los Angeles Police 
Department Crime Database. The characteristics are first viewed independently, 
before multivariate analyses are conducted. This minimizes univariate data loss 
as each column will only be responsible for its own missing values. Furthermore, 
missingness will be noted for more accurate interpretations from the dataset. 

## The Who: 
  
What are the victim profiles of crimes? Who need the most protection? The Dataset 
provides us with Victim Age, Sex, and Descent

## The What (and How?): 
  
What are the most common crimes? The Dataset provides us with up to four crime 
codes per incidence. Criminal Codes will be identified then translated using the 
LAPD Crime Code and Descriptions document. Each crime incidence report also 
includes up to 10 MO codes describing the MO. MO codes can then be translated 
using the LAPD MO code description document. 

## The When: 
  
When are these criminal incidents reported? When do they occur? What time of day 
are the crimes committed? The Dataset provides us with dates of incidents and 
report, as well as timestamps of incidence. 

## The Where: 

Where are the crimes occurring? What is the area? Where did it occur specifically? 
The Dataset provides the Area information, as well as longitude and latitude 
coordinates, and premisis description. 

# Additional Areas of Interest

## Effectiveness of Reporting Disctricts / Areas  

How effective are the police departments of Reporting Districts / Areas at 
solving crime incidents? The Dataset provides the case status of each incident 
which can be used to see which departments may need more help, as well as what 
types of help they might need based on crime codes. 
  
## Weapons of Crime 

What kinds of weapons are the police facing? What weapons are being utilized by 
criminals? The Dataset provides us with weapon codes and weapon descriptions
